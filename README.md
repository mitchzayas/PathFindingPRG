# Wave Propagation Pathfinding
This is a program for the Apple II that demonstrates [wave propagation path finding](https://youtu.be/0ihciMKlcP8). The program was written in assembly using the [CC65 Cross Compiler](https://cc65.github.io)

### Using the Program:
The program creates a grid consisting of 20 cells across and 12 cells down (240 cells total). One can move either the **Starting Cell** (S) or the **Goal Cell** (G) using the arrow keys and the path (in green) will automatically adjust to the new cell positions and around obstables.

To toggle which cell you want to move, press "S" (or "G"), then use the arrow keys to move it arround the grid. Additionally, pressing "C" toggles a cursor that can also be moved using the arrow keys, then pressing "O" places (or removes) an obstacle at the cursor's position. To quit the program, press "Q".
