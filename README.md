### How to
The program creates a grid consisting of 20 cells across and 12 cells down (240 cells total). One can move either the **Starting Cell** (S) or the **Goal Cell** (G) using the arrow keys. To toggle which cell you want to move, press "S" (or "G"), then use the arrow keys to move it arround the grid. Additionally, pressing "C" toggles a cursor that can also be moved around the grid, then pressing "O" toggles an obstacle that can be placed at the cursor's position. To quit the program, press "Q".
